            <h1>Course Information</h1>
            <p>Course Number - ILLUS-3412-01</p>
            <p>Michael McDermott - mmcderm01@risd.edu</p>
            <p>Friday 1:10 &ndash; 6:10</p>
            <p>Prov Wash Room 001</p>
            <h1>Course Description</h1>
            <p>In this course, students conceptualize, edit, design and produce either a book or the first issue of an original publication. Possibilities include: artist's book, magazine, comic book, zine, e-zine on the web, etc. Emphasis is on concept and design. We discuss editorial ideas and look at existing artists' books and publications, especially alternative forms. Using computers, we work on typography, layout and design for both print and digital mediums. Collaborations both within and outside of the class are encouraged. </p>
            <h1>Attendance and Participation</h1>
            <p>You must be physically, mentally and verbally present and prepared. Punctuality is of prime importance. There are few good excuses for being late to class, try and be as early as you can. Please come to class prepared and ready to work for the entire scheduled time. Being late twice constitutes one absence, and I record attendance each class period. By RISD policy, you are allowed one excused absence, but are encouraged not to use it. You will be dropped from the course after two unexcused absences. You will also be responsible material you missed in class. </p>
            <h1>Discussion of Work</h1>
            <p>You will need to take an active role in both the presentation and discussion of your work. We will review projects in a variety of ways and you are expected to be able to talk about your own work and give feedback to your peers about their work. The ability to talk about your work and other studentâ€™s work is a very important part of your education at RISD. Use this class to improve on those skills too.</p>
            <h1>Grading</h1>
            <p>Your grade will depend on your attendance, your participation, your process, your craft, and the completion of all the projects by the end of the class. Below is a more specific breakdown.</p>
            <p>A &ndash; Strong design process, ability to come up with many different ways to solve a problem, excellent research, mastery of form, functionality, and craftsmanship, frequent participation in critiques and discussions, strong work ethic, focused, energetic, ability to articulate ideas, resourceful.</p>
            <p>B &ndash; Solid, well-done work, could improve on items noted in A list, in particular, better process, more solutions, better craft and attention to detail, more class participation.</p>
            <p>C &ndash; Does average work, fulfills assignments but not much else, frequently late, little or no class participation, not willing to re-work or refine projects.</p>
            <p>D &ndash; Limited effort, incomplete work, lack of skill and enthusiasm, chronic tardiness and unexcused absences.</p>
            <h1>Class Website</h1>
            <p>This class will also incorporate some basic HTML/CSS throughout the semester. Each student will have a page on the main site as a place to document your progress on each project. The site will also provide basic information on the class in general as well as a page that lets you know what is going on and due the following class. This site will be updated weekly by the class and by me.</p>
