                    <li>10.9.2015 - Introduce project, get typeface</li>

                </ul>
                <p>Design Constraints</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>16 pages or more including cover</li>
                    <li>Saddle stich binding</li>
                    <li>A5 (8.3 x 5.8)</li>
                    <li>Use only the typeface provided</li>
                    <li>5 photographs or more</li>
                    <li>Black + at most 1 color</li>
                    <li>Cover on thicker paper</li>
                    <li>Colored paper can count as your color</li>
                    <li><a href="../../next/specimen.pdf">PDF of general layout</a></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Using a typeface provided you will design a type specimen book on topic you choose.</p>
                <p>That topic could be a person, place, event, thing, or something relevant to the name of the typeface. Your topic should be something that somehow relates to the typeface even if it is tangential. It needs to be able to have photographs to support it and to have enough text to work with. The text can be taken from somewhere, it does not have to be original writing. If it is copied from somewhere please site where you got the information in the booklet.</p>
                <p>If the booklet is 16 pages the set up should be as follows: Cover on page 1, inside cover on page 2, content on pages 3&ndash;14, colophon on page 15, back cover on page 16. The colophon should include your name, the paper you used, where it was printed, how it was printed, &amp;c. Any of the metadata about the booklet should appear here. If you add more pages to the 16 page minimum you must do so in increments of 4. The next page count would be 20, then 24, then 28 and so on.</p>
                <p>The final object will be a printed booklet. On the day they are due we will walk over to the typeshop to bind the books with the electric stapler. On the final day you should have two copies in class, one for me and one for you.</p>
                <p>We will look at some specimens in class on the 16th but below are some links to a few specimens I found online.</p>

                <h2>#1 // Redesign</h2>
                <p>Schedule</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>9.18.2015 - Introduce project, select book</li>
                    <li>9.25.2015 - Select size, 3 different covers,</li>
                    <li>10.2.2015 - First draft of table of contents and first chapter, One refined cover</li>
                    <li>10.9.2015 - Refined cover, refined contents, refined chapter</li>
                    <li>10.16.2015 - Redesign due</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Redesign the cover, table of contents, and first chapter of a novel you have read. The design should respond to the story of the book in some way. It might be helpful to choose a book where you can find the text digitally so you do not have to type out the first chapter.</p>
                <p>Cover - Design a front, back, and spine for the book. The front and spine should include the title and the author(s) of the book. The back should include at least a barcode and can include review quotes, synopsis of the book, or other matter related to the book.</p>
                <p>Table of Contents - Design a table of contents that shows all the parts of the book including chapters, prefaces, and epilogues if they exist.</p>
                <p>First Chapter - Take the first real chapter of the book, not a preface or introduction. The chapter should be typeset using a serif typeface. The design should include the unedited text of the chapter, the title of the chapter, and page numbers.</p>
                <p>The final object should be printed and bound as a book should be. We will go over printing and quick binding techniques in class. The cover can be wrapped around the existing book so the spine appears. If you chose a different size the cover can wrap just exist as a folded print.</p>
                <p>Look at other books to help with the structure and design of the book. Consider margins, page number locations, type size and leading, how dialogue is handled. There are many layout and formating choices that you will have to consider with each part of this project and using existing material as a reference will be helpful.</p>
